# ImageAndVideoProcessing
Repository for the Image and Video processing course at: https://www.coursera.org/course/images

This repository was deployed to keep track of my Matlab (eww) code for the Image and Video Processing class. It was not intended by any means to be production code; however, you could use it as you want if necessary.
